Issues
* Cannot use MongoDB as we currently have it on Heroku.
  - Deploy to different hosting service?
  - Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/efficiency?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_emea_united_kingdom_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624581&gclid=CjwKCAiA4rGCBhAQEiwAelVtizDjHx5031X3IqmRZghUTNn7V9t8X_S8bDyDob2mWKmhQcbf3ukDnRoCDgkQAvD_BwE) instead?


  # Book Me Up
  A web application to allow users to offer books to share with the community.

  ## Motivation
  To demonstrate the ability to build a high quality single page web app, in a new framework as part of a team practising agile development that is focused on thorough test driven development process. Also, to enjoy ourselves.

  ## Tech/framework used
  **Built with**
  - [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
  - [Atom](https://atom.io)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

  ## Features
  Key Features:

  * Add a book to lend with a barcode scanner
  * Search for books by any keyword in the free search field.
  * See details of each book
  * See 'virtual library card' of prior readers
  * Request to borrow a book from the community library

  ## Code Example
  Frontend App.JS:
  ```
  Refactors needed:
  * Remove individual title, author, isbn variables from APP.js - DONE :)
  * Rename bookSearchToo - DONE :)
  * Refactoring a User object - DONE :)
  * Combine all three header components (possibly through composition: https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html) - DONE :)
  * Create generic get request function with URL parameters
  * Error Handling Front End Set Up??
  * Refactor out BookHandler.js and UserHandler.js out of APP.js as modules?
  * Is there a better way of positioning API calls in the file structure?
  ```

  Backend app.js:
  ```
  Refactors needed:
  ```

  ## Installation
  To use locally, clone this repo, then:
  ```
  $ cd book_swap/backend
  $ npm install
  $ cd ../frontend
  $ npm install
  ```
  You will need npm, which is installed with Node.js. Please visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download.


  ### Database Installation
  You will need homebrew, if you don't please install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

  * ```$ brew tap mongodb/brew```
  * ```$ brew install mongodb-community```

  If you have not yet upgraded to MacOs Catalina or above:
  * ```$ sudo mkdir -p /data/db```
  * ```$ sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db```

  If you do have Catalina or above:
  * ```$ sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db```
  * ```$ sudo chown -R `id -un` /System/Volumes/Data/data/db```


  ## API Reference
  This project utilizes the OpenLibrary Books API: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books, to request all related book information.

  ## Tests
  Cypress for feature tests, Enzyme for React unit tests, and Mocha-Chai for Node.js tests.

  Run the following to for frontend test coverage:
  ```
  $ npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
  ```
  Run the following to open the test runner for end to end testing:
  ```
  $ cd backend
  $ npm start
  $ cd ../frontend
  $ npm start
  $ npx cypress open
  ```
  ### Linting
  We are using ESlint for frontend and backend linting.

  To run from each of the project directories:

  `$ npx eslint .`

  ## How to use?
  The frontend and backend run independently on separate servers, only in the local environment.

  To use Book Me Up:

  Terminal 1:
  ```
  $ cd backend
  $ npm start
  ```

  Terminal 2:
  ```
  $ cd frontend
  $ npm start
  ```

  Before either, ensure the mongodb is running in the background as well.

  ### Database Setup
  Mongodb needs to be running for the app to work:
  * ```$ brew services run mongodb-community```

  To check it's working:
  * ```$ brew services list```

  To Stop:
  * ```$ brew services stop mongodb-community```
